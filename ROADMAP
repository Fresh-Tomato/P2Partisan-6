-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ async list loading (done 6.x)
 + handle all the possible exceptions e.g. process stopped for unforeseen reason, manual mistake (CTRL+C), 
 + modify status page to reflect list status
 + modify status page to display the correct statup time (from first list to last one fully loaded). Or loading time on a list basis...
 - handle wget failure
 + tutor to re-attempts failed lists
 + maximum number of async loads at any given time
 + attempt a list.mirror + swap approach to update lists when P2Partisan is already running
 + add "update listname" to update individual lists manually
- improve detective function (currently beta) e.g. to spot greyports based on multiple criteria
- create whitelists routine to input data into ipset from public lists (where to be placed in the iptables?)
+ allow subnet (x.x.x.x/M) format into blacklist-custom and whitelist
 + 6.x - convert ranges into subnets (blacklist-custom and whitelist only) using Jerm routine
+ 6.x - modify the ipset -A procedure to understand cidr format (e.g. lists already in cidr format)
 + hashsize and maxelement issue to be addressed (static RAM allocation??)
- webpage to verify status
 - webpage to allow config modification e.g. add lists
- display changelog as part of the upgrade procedure
+ call custom script after p2Partisan is fully loaded (punch hole idea to modify default behaviour bird333 enquiry)?
- Make pwhitelist and pblacklistcustom convert using the external deaggregate (good idea?) 
+ Report on the status page the list as loading (pid file per list?)
 + spot ipsets created but empty (report as error)
+ Report on the status page the list memory usage
- Jerm idea not to download if the file is the latest?
 - deaggregate output to file to quick startup -> problem experienced (too slow)
 - remove duplicates when creating the file
- add whitelists (switch to single whitelist and blacklist file?
- load whitelist or (alias for backward compatibility) whitelist-custom (ln -s? or make whitelist-custom loaded only if whitelist doesn't exists?)
